Only &&, ||, comma and conditional (?:) operators specify the order in
which their operands are evaluated. All other operators do NOT guaranttee
the order. The behaviour of programs dependent on certain operands evaluation
order of those operator are undefined.

f1() * f2(); // whether f1 will be called before or after f2() is unknow
if (ia[index++] > ia[index]) // oops! does NOT define the evaluation order
