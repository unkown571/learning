Problem:

For example, use `ls' to list some files, and then use vi to view one of them 
or just run a 'man  bash', after you exit from vi/man, the original screen has 
been cleared, and you can't see the results listed by `ls'


I search and see the vi manual , I find some solutions about vi such as:

put 'set t_ti= t_te=' in ~/.vimrc

But I found that it was not a prblem only with vi but also man, so I didn't try
this solution.

I tried to echo $TERM:
$ echo $TERM
xterm-color

Then I tried to set TERM in .bashrc:
export TERM='xterm-256color'


the problem was solved.
